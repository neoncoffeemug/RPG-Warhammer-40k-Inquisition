Transmission Received

Ultra Marines here? The imperium found this place earlier than my calculations
expected, but that makes little difference to me. Your device is not working 
properly since you can't contact your superiors, and I am certain that is on 
purpose. Simple mortal conflicts concern me little, the chaos research here that
you would consider heresy was more valuable a century ago but time has destroyed
most of the important records. Even if you have been abandoned, I may have some
use for a space marine subject.

Transmission Over

As the transmission ends a patrol of necrons attack, you manage to destroy two
with quick chainsword swings, but a warrior still stands in your way.
